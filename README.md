### The programming languages and tools I am using for my repos onward
TL;DR
- Go as the performant efficient yet easy-to-use back-end language with it's handy yet lightweight web framework, namely Fiber
- HTML/template facilitates component reusability by means of inheritance with HTML-embeddable directives like `{{ define "name" }} {{ end }}`, `{{ block "name" . }} {{ end }}`, etc.
- Bootstrap as the CSS framework for a structured foundation and system to quickly prototype and build web applications with a consistent design language.
- Javascript to allow asynchronous DOM updates alongside other runtime interactivity, though server-side functions for the logic are preferred over

### Planning to do WebAssembly in the future
For WebAssembly (WASM), which is about running a pre-compiled program in the browser, suited for computation-heavy or performance-critical tasks, I am certainly looking forward to learning Rust, the low-level system language known byword for memory safety, blazingly fast execution, and strict error checking.

I know Rust is no where easy to grasp at first as Rust has advanced concepts that might feel overwhelming, requiring a steep learning curve to fully understand and master. Frustration can arise in Rust when learning to manage borrow checker, futures, lifetimes, and async constructs together, since Rust does not come with built-in async runtime so we have to rely on third-party libraries, like Tokio, async-std, or smol. But as @ThePrimeAgent put it, Rust would be easy once you get the hang of it.

### I have ceased using Java for the time being
I have made up my mind to abandon Java for a while. Being my first programming language I learned back in my first semester at university, though it was actually C during my high school days but I disliked it and so just had a glimpse of it, Java has a special place for me despite, yeah you know, it is a verbose language and kind of pain to deal with once you get into a certain level, not to mention when dealing with concurrency or multithreading, things start to get very complicated in that you need to be familiar with Thread and other related classes from Java library, that I have written a program spanning 250 lines of code just to make an async method that awaits for an input from the console before the counter, which runs async too, times out, and that program was even still not working as intended, which made me frustrated at some point. Anyways, this is not because it is kind of outdated and that I want to use something new on trend, but to be fair, the language itself sucks in many regards.

### How I get informed about a range of tools and learn how to do stuff along the way
I mostly refer to @ThePrimeAgent to gain info around programming and tech-related stuff nowadays. As for coding tutorial, I like to watch @BroCode if he has made one, so I will know like the roadmap of learning. I would mostly read the documentation on programming language to get the basic idea on the syntax and the features it offers. I tend to stumble across videos that mention coding tools worth using, may it be IDE extensions/plugins, frameworks, and so forth, which is where I get to know hidden gems, including the aforementioned ones.
